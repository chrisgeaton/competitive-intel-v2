# Executive Summary Service Design Brief

## Project Context

I have a competitive intelligence system (V2) that collects, analyzes, and delivers strategic intelligence via email. The system currently provides individual article summaries organized by priority sections (Critical, High, Medium, Low) but lacks a cohesive daily executive summary that synthesizes insights across all content.

### Current System Capabilities

1. **Data Pipeline**:
   - Discovery Service: Collects content from multiple sources
   - Analysis Service: AI-powered analysis with scoring (strategic alignment, competitive impact, urgency)
   - Report Service: Generates priority-based email reports

2. **Per-Article Analysis**:
   - Key insights extraction
   - Strategic implications
   - Action items
   - Executive summary (per article)
   - Relevance scoring (0-1 scale)

3. **User Personalization**:
   - Industry context (Technology, Healthcare, Finance, etc.)
   - Role-based filtering (CEO, CTO, Product Manager, etc.)
   - Tracked entities (competitors, partners, technologies)
   - Strategic focus areas

## Problem Statement

My V1 attempted executive summaries but they weren't effective because they:
- Were too generic and not actionable
- Simply concatenated individual summaries rather than synthesizing insights
- Failed to identify patterns and connections across content
- Lacked strategic context and implications

## Design Requirements

### 1. Daily Executive Summary Section

Create a new email section that appears at the top of daily reports with:

```
EXECUTIVE INTELLIGENCE BRIEF
[Date] | [User Name] | [Industry/Role]

TODAY'S STRATEGIC LANDSCAPE (2-3 sentences)
High-level narrative of the day's most important developments

KEY DEVELOPMENTS (3-5 items max)
• [Theme/Pattern]: Brief description with strategic implication
  Supporting articles: [count] articles from [sources]
  Recommended action: [specific, actionable step]

EMERGING PATTERNS
• Cross-cutting theme identified across [X] articles
• Competitive dynamics shift: [specific observation]
• Market signal: [trend or anomaly detected]

PRIORITY ACTIONS (2-3 items)
1. [Time-sensitive action based on aggregate analysis]
2. [Strategic opportunity/risk requiring attention]

STRATEGIC CONTEXT
• Relevance to your focus areas: [personalized connection]
• Change from yesterday: [what's new vs. continuing]
• Implications for next 30-60 days: [forward-looking insight]
```

### 2. Technical Architecture

```python
class ExecutiveSummaryService:
    """
    Synthesizes daily intelligence into actionable executive brief.
    
    Key responsibilities:
    - Aggregate all analyzed content for time period
    - Identify themes and patterns across content
    - Generate strategic synthesis using AI
    - Track temporal changes and evolution
    - Produce personalized, actionable summary
    """
    
    async def generate_daily_executive_summary(
        self,
        user_id: int,
        date: datetime,
        content_items: List[ContentItem]
    ) -> ExecutiveSummary:
        """
        Main orchestration method for executive summary generation.
        
        Steps:
        1. Cluster content by themes
        2. Extract cross-cutting insights
        3. Identify strategic patterns
        4. Compare with historical context
        5. Generate narrative synthesis
        6. Create actionable recommendations
        """
        pass
```

### 3. AI Prompt Engineering Needs

Design prompts that:

1. **Theme Identification Prompt**:
   - Input: List of article titles, key insights, and strategic implications
   - Output: 3-5 major themes with supporting article mappings
   - Constraints: Focus on strategic business impact, not just topic similarity

2. **Pattern Recognition Prompt**:
   - Input: Clustered themes and their insights
   - Output: Cross-cutting patterns, emerging trends, anomalies
   - Constraints: Highlight non-obvious connections

3. **Strategic Synthesis Prompt**:
   - Input: Themes, patterns, user context (industry, role, focus areas)
   - Output: Narrative executive brief with actionable recommendations
   - Constraints: 500 words max, action-oriented, strategic focus

4. **Temporal Analysis Prompt**:
   - Input: Today's themes + last 7 days of themes
   - Output: What's new, what's evolving, what's concluded
   - Constraints: Focus on strategic implications of changes

### 4. Data Model Requirements

```python
@dataclass
class ExecutiveSummary:
    user_id: int
    date: datetime
    
    # High-level synthesis
    strategic_landscape: str  # 2-3 sentence overview
    confidence_level: float  # 0-1 based on data quality/quantity
    
    # Key developments (3-5 max)
    key_developments: List[KeyDevelopment]
    
    # Patterns and trends
    emerging_patterns: List[Pattern]
    
    # Actionable items
    priority_actions: List[ActionItem]
    
    # Context and evolution
    strategic_context: StrategicContext
    temporal_analysis: TemporalAnalysis
    
    # Metadata
    total_articles_analyzed: int
    primary_sources: List[str]
    generation_timestamp: datetime

@dataclass
class KeyDevelopment:
    theme: str
    description: str
    strategic_implication: str
    supporting_articles: List[int]  # content_ids
    recommended_action: str

@dataclass
class ActionItem:
    action: str
    rationale: str
    priority: int  # 1-3
    deadline: Optional[str]
    related_developments: List[str]

@dataclass
class StrategicContext:
    relevance_to_focus_areas: Dict[str, str]
    competitive_implications: str

```

### 5. Implementation Considerations

1. **Performance**:
   - Cache theme clustering for reuse
   - Batch AI calls efficiently
   - Implement progressive generation (basic → detailed)

2. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Minimum content threshold (e.g., 5+ articles) for summary generation
   - Confidence scoring based on data quantity/quality
   - Fallback to section summaries if synthesis fails

3. **Personalization Levels**:
   - Industry-specific language and metrics
   - Role-appropriate action recommendations
   - Focus area weighting in theme selection

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Track which actions users take
   - Monitor email engagement metrics
   - Adjust synthesis algorithms based on usage

### 6. Integration Points

1. **With Report Service**:
   ```python
   # In report_service.py
   async def generate_report(self, request: ReportGenerationRequest):
       # ... existing code ...
       
       # Add executive summary generation
       if request.include_executive_summary:
           executive_summary = await self.executive_summary_service.generate_daily_executive_summary(
               user_id=request.user_id,
               date=request.date,
               content_items=filtered_items
           )
           
       # Insert at top of email
       if format_type == ReportFormat.EMAIL_HTML:
           content = await self._generate_email_with_executive_summary(
               executive_summary, sections, user_context
           )
   ```

2. **With Analysis Service**:
   - Reuse AnalysisContext for user personalization
   - Leverage existing scoring metrics
   - Access strategic insights and implications

3. **With Orchestration Service**:
   - Trigger summary generation after daily analysis complete
   - Include in daily pipeline execution
   - Handle batch processing for multiple users

### 7. Success Metrics

1. **Quality Metrics**:
   - Theme coherence score (articles correctly clustered)
   - Action completion rate (users acting on recommendations)
   - Synthesis accuracy (validated against human review)

2. **Engagement Metrics**:
   - Email open rates with/without executive summary
   - Click-through on recommended actions
   - Time spent reading summary section

3. **Business Impact**:
   - Time saved in intelligence review
   - Strategic decisions influenced
   - Competitive advantages identified

## Additional Notes for Claude Chat

When discussing this design, please consider:
- The system already has strong foundations (discovery, analysis, reporting)
- Cost optimization is important (using appropriate AI models)
- The solution should be maintainable and extensible
- User value is paramount - actionability over information volume
- The system processes 50-200 articles per user per day typically
- Email delivery is primary channel but API/dashboard formats needed too

Please help me:
1. Refine the technical architecture
2. Design optimal AI prompts for synthesis
3. Create efficient clustering algorithms
4. Define quality validation methods
5. Suggest implementation priorities
