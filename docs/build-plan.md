## üîß Technical Implementation Strategy

### Claude Code Usage Plan
Each service built as separate Claude Code sessions:

1. **Session 1**: User Config Service (complete CRUD + auth)
2. **Session 2**: Discovery Service (source finding + quality scoring)
3. **Session 3**: Analysis Service (enhanced AI pipeline)
4. **Session 4**: Scoring Service (relevance + priority engine)
5. **Session 5**: Integration & API Gateway
6. **Session 6**: Report Generation & Delivery

### Code Organization
