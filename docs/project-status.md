# Project Status - Competitive Intelligence v2

## Current Status: Foundation Complete âœ…

**Date**: August 20, 2025  
**Phase**: Database & Environment Setup Complete  
**Next Phase**: User Config Service Development with Claude Code

## What's Working

### Infrastructure âœ…
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Running locally via Docker container `competitive-intel-db`
- **Database Schema**: 15 tables created successfully (users, strategic profiles, tracking entities, etc.)
- **Python Environment**: Virtual environment active with all core dependencies
- **Project Structure**: Clean folder organization in `competitive-intel-v2`

### Dependencies Installed âœ…
- FastAPI 0.116.1 (web framework)
- psycopg 3.2.9 (PostgreSQL driver) 
- uvicorn (ASGI server)
- pydantic (data validation)
- python-jose (JWT authentication)
- passlib (password hashing)
- python-dotenv (environment variables)

### Database Connection âœ…
- PostgreSQL running on localhost:5432
- Database: `competitive_intelligence`
- User: `admin` / Password: `yourpassword`
- All 15 tables created with proper indexes and foreign keys

## Current User (Testing)
- Chris Eaton (ceaton@livedata.com)
- Testing new system while keeping 3 alpha users on old system
- Will test different industry focus (possibly nonprofit/fishery management)

## Project Vision Achieved So Far

### Architecture Separation âœ…
Successfully designed three separate services:
1. **Discovery Service**: Smart information finding
2. **Analysis Service**: Strategic intelligence extraction  
3. **Scoring Service**: Relevance & priority engine

### Database Design âœ…
Moved from config file + SQLite hybrid to clean PostgreSQL schema supporting:
- Strategic profile-driven intelligence (not just competitor tracking)
- Flexible entity tracking (competitors, organizations, topics, people, technologies)
- Self-service user preference management
- Rich analysis storage with cost tracking
- Extensible source discovery

### User Experience Enhancement âœ…
Designed system to solve key pain points:
- âœ… Single source of truth (database only, no config files)
- âœ… Real-time preference updates (no restart required)
- âœ… Self-service configuration (users manage their own preferences)
- âœ… Strategic intelligence focus (personalized based on user goals)

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Start Claude Code Development
- Build User Config Service first (foundation for all other services)
- Create database models using psycopg3
- Build FastAPI endpoints for user management
- Implement authentication system

### 2. User Config Service Components
- User registration and authentication
- Strategic profile management (industry, role, goals)
- Entity tracking preferences  
- Focus area management
- Delivery preferences

### 3. Testing Strategy
- Use Chris as test user on new system
- Test with nonprofit/fishery management use case
- Compare results with current system performance

```

### Docker Commands
```bash
# Start PostgreSQL
docker start competitive-intel-db

# Connect to database
docker exec -it competitive-intel-db psql -U admin -d competitive_intelligence

# Stop PostgreSQL
docker stop competitive-intel-db
```

## Success Metrics Defined
- **Technical**: 99.9% uptime, <200ms API response times, zero data loss
- **Business**: Maintain all current functionality, improved UX scores
- **Operational**: Automated deployments, comprehensive monitoring

## Risk Mitigation
- âœ… Building new system parallel to old (no disruption to alpha users)
- âœ… Clean database schema designed for migration
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation for continuity
- âœ… Modular architecture for independent development

## Timeline Target
- **Week 1**: User Config Service + Discovery Service foundation
- **Week 2**: Analysis Service integration + basic frontend
- **Total**: 1-2 week timeline (faster than original 8-week plan)

## Resources Ready
- Database schema artifact available
- All dependencies installed and tested
- Docker environment running
- Documentation structure established

**STATUS: Ready to begin Claude Code development of User Config Service** ðŸš€
